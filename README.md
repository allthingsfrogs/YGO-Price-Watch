YGO Price Watch is a project that allows you to keep track of the price of Yu-Gi-Oh trading cards from the singles market. Whether it be for competition or collecting purposes, there's often a need to buy individual cards off the second hand "singles" market instead of spending money on the randomized boxes or packs of product, from which there is no gauarentee that you'll pull the cards you need.

As an avid collector of Yu-Gi-Oh trading cards, I built this to help me keep track of the cards I want while learning Web Development using Python and Django.

You can search for a card via its name or print id, and a list of all version of that card will be shown on a search results page. From there, you can view the prices of the card and favorite the ones you are interested in. Favorited cards will be displayed on the home page to quickly reference.
